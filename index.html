<h2><strong>Re: Eileen Dover university application</strong></h2>

<p>Dear Eileen,</p>
<p> Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part<br>
of your PhD next year. I will asnwer your question one by one, in the following sections.
</p>

<h2><strong>Starting dates</strong></h2></h2>
<p>We are happy to accomodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you<br>
could start at the beginning of a semester; the  start dates for each one are as follows:
</p>

<ul>
<li>First semester:<time datetime="2016-09-09"> 9 September 201</time>6</li>
<li>Second semester:<time datetime="2017-01-15"> 15 Junuary 2017</time></li>
<li>Third semester:<time datetime="2017-05-02"> 2 May 2017</time></li>
</ul>
<p id="p1">Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.</p>
<p id="p2">You can find more information about <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/" style="color: blue;">important university dates</a> on your website.</p>
<h2>Subjects of study</h2>

<p>At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a retty open-minded research facilty &mdash; as lomgas the subjects fall<br>
somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just<br>
the kind of person we'd like to have on your team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued<br> 
by are as follows, in order of priority:</p>

<ol>
<li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.)</li>
<li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30&deg;C(86&deg;F), when the<br>
audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 &times; 10<sup>3</sup>&gt; 3 &times; 10<sup>4</sup>.)</li>
<li><ins>HTML</ins> and <ins>CSS</ins> constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
</ol>
<p>So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, inecluding how long you'd expect the<br>
rescarch to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.</p>

<h2>Exotic dance moes</h2>

<p>Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I <i>did</i> study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question,<br>
my favourite dancer are as follows, with definitions:
</p>

<dl>
   <dt>Polynesian chichken dance</dt>
   <dd>A little known but <i>very</i>influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village would dance arround<br>
    in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock or be "fruitfull".   
   </dd>
   <dt>Icelandic brownian shuffle</dt>
   <dd>Before the Icelanders developed fore as a means of getting warm, they used to practice the dance, which<br>
    involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptably<br>
    tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired<br>
    modern styles such as Twerking.
    </dd>
    <dt>Actic robot dance</dt>
    <dd>An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believed to have<br> discovered a new dance style characterised by "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants<br> of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this<br> because they were really cold.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Yours sincerely,</p>
